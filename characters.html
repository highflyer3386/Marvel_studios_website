                          humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control 
                          magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects 
                          the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world 
                          to enable mutants, whom he refers to as Homo superior, to replace humans as the dominant 
                          species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be 
                          a Holocaust survivor whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination 
                          to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and 
                          persecutes mutants. He is a friend of Professor X, the leader of the X-Men, but their 
                          different philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times.</p>
